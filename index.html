        <li>This was just the dangdest job. Everyone hired was told they got the job because they were a "lateral thinker," which sounded fun to me.</li>
        <li>I once worked on a project related to escrow for a major bank, and for a moment I nearly understood escrow.</li>
        <li>Fascinating peek behind the curtain of corporate America and some people who succeed in a corporate atmosphere.</li>

  <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Improv taught me how to see everything as an opportunity.</li>
        <li>Improv is an exercise in focusing attention, a skill I believe will be helpful when navigating aspects of design.</li>
        <li>HUGE allowed me to maintain a connection to many of the social changes happening around me in real time. The leadership at HUGE recognized that so many people were being left out of improv and took active measures to change that. It's an honor to be in the room.</li>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>I worked at this neighborhood bar in an old city for almost ten years, thereby fulfilling my childhood dream of working at Cheers.</li>
        <li>I got to see so much lovely and stupid stuff. I quit drinking early in my tenure here, which frequently made me a default adult in the room.</li>
        <li>I was very good at washing and organizing glasses quickly and efficiently. I found great joy in making things orderly. Having now done a spot of coding, I think it strikes the same logical nerve.</li>

        <li>During my mid-20's, during the mid-aughts, I managed this little bar in downtown Austin, Texas.</li>
        <li>I tended bar five nights a week and I loved it. I did my best to build a community and I cried like a baby when I left.</li>
        <li>I didn't have any experience as a bartender when I got this job. The first few weeks involved making up a lot of stuff and figuring out how to throw people out of a bar without havng to physically fight them.</li>
